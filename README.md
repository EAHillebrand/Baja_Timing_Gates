# Baja_Timing_Gates
  * Timing Gates to measure various time trials for Baja
    * Using two pressure switches connected to liquid filled tubes
    * Start and stop times will be recorded by arduino connected to both sensors
    * All code will be commited as .ino file type
    * Arduino UNO board is being used
    * Future idea is to communicate between start and finish line with X-Bee
    * Currently, standard 14/2 wire will be used to relay switch response
